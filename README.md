This is a badge maker app that was started around the end of March
2012.

The prototype was meant to export [Open Badges][], but at the time
it was made, the open badge specification didn't support SVG. In
the worst-case scenario, a server could convert the SVG graphics
into PNG files, using e.g. [PhantomJS][], and even [bake][] in assertions.

All the SVG art in this project is by [Jessica Klein][].
